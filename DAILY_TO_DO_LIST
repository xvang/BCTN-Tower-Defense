- Add more enemies. spiders,pigs, stuff?

- start working on collisions animations. collision manager?

- figure out an endgame.

- fusion towers. 6 towers, 15 total combinations.

- special attacks.

- BALANCE THE TOWERS AND ENEMIES

- SPAWN THE NEW ENEMIES



- How paths were changed.
    Instead of multiple complete paths, a path will be broken into segments.
    This means enemies will spawn at different parts of a map.
    implement "zigzag" to make the movements seem random.
