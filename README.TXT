Some parts of the project are on hold for the moment.
I don't have capable devices to debug on.
At the moment, I am mostly debugging in Desktop Mode.

Some TO-DO's:

- Balance the game. Maybe a rock-paper-scissor system.

- Once towers and enemies are balanced, items and their effects can be determined.

- Update documentations.

- Proper commenting.
